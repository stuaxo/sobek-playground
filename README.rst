Introduction
============

This project is intended to be used primarily as a submodule of Sobek itself,
and serves as a place where people can easily add their own examples into the
Sobek ecosystem without affecting the core project itself.

By default it is cloned into the "examples" directory of a Sobek checkout,
and has hooks for accessing the core assets as well (in addition to providing
its own!) These can be found in the misc.common module, which adds some common
paths and allows you to define a variable, SOBEK_ASSETS, which points to your
Sobek checkout's assets directory.
